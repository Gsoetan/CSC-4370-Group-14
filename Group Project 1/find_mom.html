	<H1>You decide to take up the task yourself</H1>
	<p>You start walking the kid back through where she remembers being with her mother. It's not until almost 30 mins later that you hear a woman's voice yell out a name. It's then that the kids eyes turn attention to the voice and run in the direction of it.</p>
	<p> The mother thanks you so much. You feel so proud of yourself and return towards school without fear of being late, because a missing child is worse than than a tardy or absence.
